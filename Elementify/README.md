# Elementify
You can convert any string you like into their equivalent elements(almost).
<br>
At the time of writing their are `118` elements in the Periodic Table, hence to make the code work on almost all names I have added a few hypothetical names of elements untill they actually appear in the Periodic Table
<br>
## To Run:
To elementify your name open terminal and run the file<br>
```python run.py```
<br><br>
You can also pass the arguments in the terminal like<br>
```python run.py --name Vibhor```
<br><br>
If you need to print their Atomic Number also<br>
```python run.py -m```
