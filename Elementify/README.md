# Elementify
You can convert almost any string you like into it's equivalent element symbol string.
<br>
At the time of writing there are `118` elements in the Periodic Table, hence to make the code work on all names I have added a few hypothetical symbols (which you can check [here](run.py)) untill they actually appear in the Periodic Table
<br>
## To Run:
To elementify your name open terminal and run the file<br>
```python run.py```
<br><br>
You can also pass the arguments in the terminal like<br>
```python run.py --name Vibhor```
<br><br>
If you need to print their Atomic Number also you can use -m or --more<br>
```python run.py -m```
